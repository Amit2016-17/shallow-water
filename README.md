# Shallow water equations
Model solving the 2D [shallow water equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shallow_water_equations). In particular, the momentum equations are linearized while the continuity equation is solved non-linearly.

As it is set right now it initates with a large gaussian bump in the domain and resulting waves propagate away from the bump and then interacts with the walls (no flow condition). Feel free to play around with the parameters to your liking. You might have to make some tweeks to the colorscale and arrowscale for some of the plots if you change some parameters.
