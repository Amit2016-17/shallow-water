# ShallowFluidModel2D
Model solving the 2D shallow water equations (linear momentum, nonlinear continuity).

As it is set right now it initates with a lrage gaussian bump in the domain and resulting
waves propagate away from the bump and then interacts with the walls (no flow condition).
However, feel free to play around with the parameters to your liking. You might have to
make some tweeks to the colorscale and arrowscale for some of the plots if you change some
parameters.
